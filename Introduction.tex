%it might be a good idea to put the physical values of gmc's in here
Star formation is one of the fundamental processes in astrophysics that effect not just stellar and planetary formation but also dictate behavior in galaxy formation and evolution \citep{kennicutt2012}.  The study of star formation itself can be broken into several areas such as: the processes that trigger collapse and how the collapse behaves, dictating how and what type of stars can form from a given region or cloud, or how the inflow of new material can alter current star forming environments.  These different sub-branches of star formation are conviently sorted into a hierarchal schemes that range from Mpc scales seen in gas accretion from the intergalactic medium, to small scale effects on the order $R_\odot$ or AU \citep{kennicutt2012}.

After the intergalactic gas has accreted into a host galaxy, it will eventually condense and begin to form a giant molecular cloud (GMC).  The formation of molecular clouds has divided between two camps; either a ``bottom-up'' or ``top-down'' formation \citep{mckee2007}.  The bottom-up scenario consists of small clouds of cold HI coagulating to eventually form a GMC \citep{field1965, kwan1979}.  The major concern with the bottom-up scenario is the time scales required to form a cloud typical of what we observe.  The time scale required would take around $10^8$ years which is longer than the expected GMC lifetime \citep{mckee2007}.  

The alternative formation scenario, top-down, postulates the GMC formation comes from instabilities in diffuse ISM causing the clouds to collapse from their surrounding medium \citep{mckee2007}.  Two main instabilities are thought to be responsible for the collapse.  The first type of instability is the parker instability, which involves distortion of magnetic fields in the mid plane of the galaxy, and at these distortions gas will begin to accumulate \citep{parker1966, dobbs2013}.  The second instability responsible for collapse comes in the style of a more complex Jeans instability which is determined further by the amount of rotational shear present \citep{mckee2007}.  If a strong rotational shear is present, such as in the inter arm region of a spiral galaxy, then a process known as swing amplification will occur \citep{mckee2007}.  If no rotational shear is present, such as the inner regions of a galaxy or spiral arms, then the collapse can be attributed to a magneto-Jeans instability \citep{elmegreen1987,kim2001}.

During the collapse or coagulation of a GMC, molecular hydrogen is being formed inside of the cloud.  The formation of molecular hydrogen can be summarized using either the two bodied reaction, three bodied reaction, formation using free a electron or proton, or surface formation \citep{krumholz2014}.  The two bodied formation scenario is the simplest reaction using two hydrogen atoms to molecular hydrogen, reaction \ref{eq:2bod}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:2bod}
  \ce{H + H -> H_2}
\end{equation}

However the two bodied formation is not the major mechanism in the formation of H$_2$ due to the requirement of a forbidden photon that arises from the combination of hydrogen atoms in the ground state \citep{gould1963}.  If one of the hydrogen atoms is excited, the transition can occur, but the amount of excited hydrogen atoms in the temperature ranges typical of the cold and warm phases of the ISM are expected to be nearly nonexistent \citep{krumholz2014}.

The second formation scenario listed, the three bodied formation, involves three hydrogen atoms coming together to form molecular hydrogen with a spare hydrogen atom shown in reaction \ref{eq:3bod}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:3bod}
  \ce{3H -> H_2 + H}
\end{equation}

The three bodied formation scenario however is not expected to be the dominant form of H$_2$ formation due to the required density of $10^8$ cm$^-3$ \citep{palla1983,abel1997}, while the normal density of a GMC is on the order of 300 cm$^-3$ \citep{krumholz2014}.

An alternative to the two or three bodied reactions uses either an electron or proton to ionize the hydrogen forming either H$^-$ or H$_2^+$ \citep{krumholz2014}.  The chemical reaction involving an electron is shown in reaction \ref{eq:eform} and reaction utilizing a proton is shown in reaction \ref{eq:eform}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eform}
  \begin{split}
    \ce{H + \it{e} -> H^- + \it{h\nu}} \\
    \ce{H^- + \it{e} -> H_2 + \it{e}}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:pform}
  \begin{split}
    \ce{H + H^+ -> H^+_2 + \it{h\nu}} \\
    \ce{H^+_2 + H -> H_2 + H^+}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

The main limitation of the free electron/proton formation mechanism is an undersupply of free electrons and protons.  Typical Milky Way conditions show that in regions $>$1 cm$^-3$ have free electron and proton densities $<$10$^-4$ cm$-3$ \citep{wolfire2003}.  Secondly, the H$^-$ ion in reaction \ref{eq:eform} is more likely to interact with a stray photon rather than an electron resulting in ion to return to the atomic state \citep{glover2003}.  While we observe singly ionized hydrogen regions, HII regions, only a small fraction of the region will successfully produce molecular hydrogen.

While the free electron/proton formation method is suspected to be the primary H$_2$ catalyst in the early universe \citep{herbst2005}, at low redshifts the formation of molecular hydrogen on the surface of dust grains is the dominant mechanism of formation \citep{krumholz2014}.  The surface formation of molecular hydrogen will occur when a hydrogen atom strikes a dust grain and successfully sticks to the grain.  The hydrogen then will then interact with another hydrogen atom to form H$_2$ and be ejected off of the dust particle after the reaction has occurred \citep{pirronello1997}.  The same process occurs on the dust grain as the two bodied formation, but  the dust grain will act as a medium to absorb the energy that would create the forbidden photon \citep{krumholz2014}.

With a dominant mechanism for molecular hydrogen formation, a reaction rate can be defined based on the cross section of the grain,$\Sigma_{gr}$, a striking probability dependent on the temperature of the observed dust, S(T), the probability of molecular hydrogen forming on the grain, $\upepsilon_{H_2}$, density of hydrogen nucleon, n$_H$, and the density of free hydrogen in the GMC, n$_H{_0}$ \citep{krumholz2014}.  Scaling this with the integrated collisional probability of a Maxwellian gas, a reaction rate is derived and shown in equation \ref{eq:reac_rate} where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and m$_H$ is the mass of the hydrogen atom.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:reac_rate}
  \frac{dn_{H_2}}{dt} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{8k_bT}{\pi m_H}\right)^\frac{1}{2}\Sigma_{gr}S\left(T\right)\upepsilon_{H_2}n_{H}n_{H_0}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:reac_rate} is often simplified to equation \ref{eq:reac_rate_sm} by introducing a variable known as the formation rate, $\mathcal{R}_{gr}$ that is onstrained using the column densities CI, CII, HI, H$_2$, and has been found to be 3x10$^{-17}$cm$^3$s$^{-1}$ for the Milky Way \citep{jura1975, gry2002, wolfire2008}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:reac_rate_sm}
  \frac{dn_{H_2}}{dt} = \mathcal{R}_{gr}n_H n_{H_0}
\end{equation}

When the molecular hydrogen has formed, it is still susceptible to photodisasociation from far ultra-violet (FUV) photons.  The energy required in a single photon to break the bonds of molecular hydrogen is 14.5 eV which conveniently is also enough energy to excite atomic hydrogen, so photodisasociation using a single photon is highly unlikely \citep{krumholz2014}.  However, a photon with an energy of 11-13.6 eV will not be able to excite atomic hydrogen, but will be able to excite the molecular hydrogen to its first and second excitation levels, the Lyman and Werner bands respectively.  The excited H$_2$ will eventually settle via photon emission to it's ground state with a finite probability of returning to two hydrogen atoms rather than maintaing it's molecular state \citep{krumholz2014}.

A disassociation rate, $\zeta_{diss}$, can be obtained by scaling the excitation rate, $\zeta_{exc}$, by the fraction of excited hydrogen molecules that will settle to an atomic ground state \citep{krumholz2014}.  The excitation rate for the Milky Way is found by summing each of the possible excitations.  In the Milky Way's diffuse ISM, the interstellar radiation field is 6-9x10$^-14$ erg cm$^-3$ over the range of 6-13.6 eV resulting in $\zeta_{exc} \approx 3\times10^-10$s$^{-1}$ \citep{draine2011}.  The expected fraction of H$_2$ to disassociate is between 0.11 and 0.13 resulting in $\zeta_{diss}\approx4\times10^{-11}$s$^{-1}$\citep{draine2011}.
Equating the formation and disassociation rates then solving for a molecular hydrogen vs atomic hydrogen ratio is shown in equation \ref{eq:fd_eq1} \citep{krumholz2014}.  From equation \ref{eq:fd_eq1} we can see, in the diffuse medium, atomic hydrogen is far more abundant which is of no surprise.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:fd_eq1}
  \begin{split}
    \frac{n_{H_2}}{n_H} & = \frac{\mathcal{R}n_{H_0}}{\zeta_{diss}} \\
                        & = 8\times10^{-6}\left(\frac{4\times10^{-11}s^{-1}}{\zeta_{diss}}\right)\left(\frac{n_{H_0}}{10cm^{-3}}\right)
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

However, as the density of the gas increases via collapse or coagulation, the optical depth will also increase limiting the amount of FUV photons to penetrate deeply into the cloud; a process known as shielding \citep{draine2011}.  This shielding will aid in the decrease of $\zeta_{diss}$ which will increase the value in equation \ref{eq:fd_eq1}.  The increase in molecular to atomic hydrogen ratio signifies the accumulation of molecular gas reservoirs.  The molecular gas build up will eventually lead to further collapse within the cloud that will eventual y lead to forming stars.  It is this stage of molecular gas development in star formation that we are examining in this thesis.
