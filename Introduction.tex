\begin{itemize}
  \item Roll of Gas and Dust in Star Formation
    \begin{itemize}
      \item It might be good to talk about the processes in star formation and then look at what phases we 
    \end{itemize}

  \item Dust to gas ratio
    \begin{itemize}
      \item What the DGR can tell us about the sfr environment / it's importance this would include things like what different values can tell us
      \item Components and how to calculate it.  Go into the need for $\alpha_{co}$
      \item Leroy minimization technique and it's history and then new applications (sandstrom paper).
    \end{itemize}

  \item Spectral Energy Distribution of Dust
    \begin{itemize}
      \item What SED's can tell us and their comonents.  I believe Draine has a pretty kick ass paper on this.
      \item Go into cold component and derive the modified black body.  This would be a good time to go over what $\kappa$ and $\beta$ are.
      \item Some properties of cold dust emission pretty much talk about the 850 excess and go over the galametz paper that chris sent.
    \end{itemize}

  \item NGC3627 on a whole
    \begin{itemize}
      \item go into previous studies  There is the reuters paper, all of the kingfish stuff, accuarate distances with Ia SNe.  Look for information regarding the nucleus and an slight AGN.  Tidal tails with HI in leo triplet.
    \end{itemize}
