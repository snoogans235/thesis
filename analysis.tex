\subsection{Method for Fitting}


%there should be a decent write up on the SED of dust focusing on cold component in the intro
%some of the topics to hit on:
%how the fitting took place -- i.e. levinberg-marquardt
%pixel by pixel and region flux
%varying opacities -- also go into how T, beta, and mass would change the shape of the SED
%discrediting the 450$\mu$m emission
%define the regions
%determine an appropriate mass and surf-d for DGR
