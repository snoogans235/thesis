\chapter{Conclusions}

We have analyzed the interferometric CO observations of the local LIRG Arp 299 published in \citet{2008ApJS..178..189W}. CO transition line ratios were used to constrain the physical conditions of each region of Arp 299 using the radiative transfer code RADEX. The RADEX solutions show two situations for regions A, A$^{\prime}$ and B, where one of either temperature or density is constrained and the other is not. The RADEX modelling shows a solution for $T_{kin}$ $\sim$ 30-500 K (up to 1000 K for region B) and $n$(H$_{2}$) $\sim$ 0.3 - 3 $\times$ 10$^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $T_{kin}$ $\sim$ 10-30 K and $n$(H$_{2}$) $>$ 3 $\times$ 10$^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$. This indicates a two component gas but our $^{12}$CO J=3-2 observations likely do not trace the warm gas component and we need higher J-level $^{12}$CO transition lines to trace the warm gas. We cannot rule out a warm/hot gas solution. Region C corresponding to the overlap region of Arp 299 shows a well-constrained RADEX solution with $T_{kin}$ $\sim$ 15-30 K, $n$(H$_{2}$) $\sim$ 3 - 30 $\times$ 10$^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $N$($^{12}$CO) $\sim$ 0.9-2 $\times$ 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$. This solution is comparable to giant molecular clouds in the normal spiral galaxy M33. The column densities of these clouds (corrected with a filling factor), is about 1.7-3.3 times lower than the RADEX solution column density for region C which may indicate that clouds are spaced close together in region C.

We have used the CO observations to calculate the gas and dynamical masses of each region. We find that region A has $M$(H$_{2}$) = 6.2 $\times$ 10$^{8}$ $M_{\odot}$ and $M_{dyn}$ = 3.2 $\times$ 10$^{9}$ $M_{\odot}$, region B has $M$(H$_{2}$) = 2.6 $\times$ 10$^{8}$ $M_{\odot}$ and $M_{dyn}$ = 1.3 $\times$ 10$^{9}$ $M_{\odot}$, and region C has $M$(H$_{2}$) = 3.4 $\times$ 10$^{8}$ $M_{\odot}$ and $M_{dyn}$ = 0.5 $\times$ 10$^{9}$ $M_{\odot}$. Using the infrared luminosity we derived the star formation rate of each region to be 38.5 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for region A, 20.9 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for region B and 10.1 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for region C. We found that the depletion times of each region are about 2 orders of magnitude lower than for normal spiral galaxies and resemble the depletion timescales of giant molecular clouds. The lower timescales may be explained by a higher fraction of dense gas than in normal spiral galaxies. 

As for future work, this project can be improved by obtaining another $^{13}$CO transition line observation in order to better constrain the physical conditions. Another possibility to constrain the physical conditions is to obtain a dense gas tracer such as HCO+ or HCN; however adding these lines into our RADEX models will introduce more uncertainties because we are assuming another H$_{2}$ abundance ratio. The analysis can further be improved by recovering the short spacings of the $^{12}$CO J=1-0 and $^{13}$CO J=2-1 maps. We have proposed to observe Arp 299 in $^{13}$CO J=2-1 using the JCMT but the observations are currently not complete. In order to determine if the merger state has an effect on the physical conditions, more RADEX modelling of U/LIRGs needs to be done. The sample of Wilson et al. (2008) has 13 other U/LIRGs that have not been analyzed in great detail.
