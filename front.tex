\textit{When life looks like easy street, there is danger at your door... -Robert Hunter}\\

First and foremost I would like to thank my advisor Chris for helping me interpret my results and for polishing the roughest of thesis drafts to get a final copy out.  I would also like to thank my officemates, Damien, Kaz, Max, Tara, and Angus, for the putting up with office pranks and shenanigans and their invaluable input into research discussions.  I would also like to thank the other offices for the much needed coffee breaks and general comradery. Go Liquid State!  I would also like to thank my parents for having me and always being there if things got a little rough.  I would like to thank the rest of my family for their never ending encouragement.  I also need to thank Christian who laid the initial groundwork to making SCUBA-2 Maps.  I would also like to thank John Elway whose front office prowess has helped to make Sundays much more bearable.  Go Broncos!
