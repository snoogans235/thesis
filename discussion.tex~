\section{x$_{CO}$ Value for Region C}

In section 3.5, we calculated the average H$_{2}$ column density for region C and compared it to the RADEX $^{12}$CO column density solution to derive a CO-to-H$_{2}$ abundance, $x_{CO}$. Our derived factor is about  3 - 6 times less than the assumed value of 3 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$, the average Galactic value. This difference may be interpreted in two ways. One explanation can be that the abundance of $^{12}$CO to H$_{2}$ is different in this region of Arp 299 than the average Galactic value. Another explanation is, if we assume that the Galactic value is correct for this region of Arp 299, then the column density estimated with $\alpha$ (=$M_{H_{2}}$/$L_{CO}^{\prime}$) is too high, which means that the value of $\alpha$ is smaller than 0.8 $M_{\odot}$(K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{2}$)$^{-1}$.  There is no way of telling which scenario is right and it may be a combination of the two. 

\section{Depletion Times}

The depletion times of each region (see Table 3.8) are quite fast compared to normal spiral galaxies. The timescales are more similar to the lifetime of a giant molecular cloud in the Large Magellenic Cloud (20-30 Myr; Kawamura et al., 2009)\nocite{2009ApJS..184....1K}. This leads to the question whether the star formation rates are over estimated due to contributions from AGNs. \citet{2010ApJ...714L.118D} studied the star formation laws in disks and starbursts at low and high redshifts. They provide evidence that disks and starbursts occupy distinct regions in the gas mass versus star formation rate (or $L_{IR}$) plane (see Figure \ref{daddi}). Starbursts are seen to have 10 times higher $L_{IR}$ at fixed $M_{gas}$. From the plot, we can see that U/LIRGs have depletion times on the order of 10$^{7}$ years while spiral galaxies have depletion times in the range of 0.6 - 2.4 Gyr. Around the same time, \citet{2010MNRAS.407.2091G} also find the same bimodal trend. This trend could be explained by an IMF that is more top heavy than in normal disk galaxies \citep{2010ApJ...714L.118D, 2010MNRAS.407.2091G}. \citet{2010MNRAS.407.2091G} argues that there is no convincing evidence in the local Universe for this situation except in the vicinity of the black hole in the Galactic center; therefore this explanation is unlikely but cannot be ignored until further observational evidence is presented.

This bimodal trend is shown to disappear when the gas masses are divided by the dynamical times, $\tau_{dyn}$ by both  \citet{2010ApJ...714L.118D} and \citet{2010MNRAS.407.2091G} (see Figure \ref{tdyn}). This is the first time that global galaxy properties that determine $\tau_{dyn}$ are shown to be related to the regulation to the local process like star formation.  This interesting result suggests that a difference in IMFs cannot explain the trend as different IMFs would break the single relations found by using $\tau_{dyn}$ \citep{2010ApJ...714L.118D}. The most likely explanation is that mergers form stars much faster because the clouds are more compressed with shorter dynamical times so that they can use up the gas reservoir much more quickly than normal spiral galaxies. This explanation is consistent with the $L_{IR}$ vs $L_{HCN}$ linear correlation (Gao $\&$ Solomon 2004; see Chapter 1.1.2). Using this correlation, the bimodal trend can be seen as starbursts having a higher fraction of dense gas than normal disk galaxies at a fixed $L_{IR}$. This explanation may likely be the case for Arp 299 since our RADEX solutions show a cold dense gas for all regions.

In order to increase the depletion time to similar values of normal spiral galaxies, we need one of two things to happen: the molecular mass must be increased or the star formation rate must decrease. If the star formation rates are correct, to get depletion times on the order of a Gyr, we need molecular gas masses that are $>$ 10$^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$. This is not possible because it exceeds the dynamical masses derived in Chapter 3.2. If the entire dynamical masses were purely due to molecular gas, the depletion times would increase by about 4 times for region A and B and by only about 1.1 for region C. These depletion time scales  using the dynamical masses are still much lower than of a normal spiral galaxy. In the previous section, we showed that the abundance ratio $\alpha$, may be smaller than the value of 0.8 $M_{\odot}$(K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{2}$)$^{-1}$ we use to derive molecular gas masses. This would mean that the gas masses we derive are overestimates and would also imply that our depletion timescales are overestimates. 

If the gas masses are correct, then the star formation rates may be overestimated. If we assume that the AGNs contribute 50$\%$ to the total infrared luminosity, the depletion times scales are increased by 2. These timescales are still much lower than of a normal spiral galaxy. To get the timescales up to 1 Gyr, the AGN contribution must be greater than 95$\%$. This is highly unlikely considering the evidence for a star formation powered system (see Chapter 1). As for region C, no AGN is associated with this region; therefore the total infrared luminosity must be due to star formation. This is quite an interesting region considering that region C is not associated with the nucleus of another galaxy but has a star formation rate much higher than a normal spiral galaxy. 

\section{RADEX Solutions}

Our RADEX solutions for regions A, B and A$^{\prime}$ show two situations, a density constrained with temperature unconstrained solution and a temperature constrained with density unconstrained solution. This can be interpreted as a double component solution with a moderately dense warm ($T_{kin}$ $>$ 30K) gas component and a dense cold ($T_{kin}$ $\sim$ 10-30 K) gas component. Our observations likely do not trace the warm gas that is seen in the RADEX solutions because $^{12}$CO J=3-2 traces gas temperatures of T $\sim$ 30 K; therefore we cannot say that there is a warm gas component from our solution but a warm gas cannot be ruled out. \citet{2006ApJ...648..323H} has shown using mid-infrared $Spitzer$ spectra that ULIRGs typically have less than 1$\%$ of warm ($T$ $>$ 100K) H$_{2}$ gas compared to the total H$_{2}$ gas mass traced by the $^{12}$CO transition lines. This would indicate that Arp 299 could have about 2 $\times$ 10$^{7}$ $M_{\odot}$ of warm H$_{2}$ gas. If Arp 299 does have a warm component up to $T_{kin}$ $\sim$ 500 K, we would expect to see strong emission in higher J-level $^{12}$CO lines in the $Herschel$ FTS spectrum. The $Herschel$ FTS spectrum for Arp 299 has not yet been published ; however, the data has become public. Taking a sneak peek at the spectrum shows a prominent $^{12}$CO transition ladder with strong emission of higher J-level transition lines up to $^{12}$CO J=13-12. A radiative transfer modelling solution of these CO transition lines would almost certainly show a warm/hot ($T_{kin}$ $>$ 100K) gas component as higher J-level transition lines probe regions of denser ($n$(H$_{2}$) $\approx$ 3 $\times$ 10$^{3}J^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$; see Tielens, 2005)\nocite{2005pcim.book.....T} and hotter gas ($T$ $\approx$ 3$J^{2}$ K). 

RADEX modelling was performed with $Herschel$ FTS observations for the prototype starburst M82 \citep{2010A&A...518L..37P}. The spectrum shows a noticeable CO ladder from J=4-3 to 13-12 which indicates a warm gas component. \citet{2010A&A...518L..37P} used a likelihood model and the spectrum of M82 with a 43$\arcsec$.4 beam to constrain the physical conditions. The most probable solution is $T_{kin}$ = 545 K, $n$(H$_{2}$) = 10$^{3.7}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $N$($^{12}$CO) = 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$. This solution is quite similar to the warm/hot gas solution that we see in the nuclei and the disk portion of IC 694. A cold component solution of $T_{kin}$ $\sim$ 30 K with $n$(H$_{2}$) = 2.5 $\times$ 10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$ has also been found using ground based observations \citep{2000ApJ...538L.117P} which is similar to what we see in our RADEX solutions for region C.  

Local velocity gradient (LVG) modelling was also performed on a sample of seven GMCs in the normal spiral galaxy M33 \citep{1997ApJ...483..210W}. The average of six clouds resulted in a solution of $T_{kin}$ =10-20 K, $n$(H$_{2}$) = 4-30 $\times$ 10$^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $N$($^{12}$CO) = 3-6 $\times$ 10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$. This average solution resembles our RADEX solution for region C very well except the column density is lower. The column density solution from Wilson et al. (1997) is an average column density over the size of the beam. We can determine the average column density over the cloud by determining the filling factor of the cloud within the beam
\begin{equation}
ff = \frac{D_{cloud}^{2}}{D_{beam}^{2}}
\end{equation}
where $D_{cloud}$ is the diameter of the cloud and $D_{beam}$ is the physical diameter of the beam (=85 pc). Using the equation in \citet{1990ApJ...363..435W}
\begin{equation}
 V_{FWHM} = 1.2 D_{pc}^{0.5}
 \end{equation}
where $V_{FWHM}$ is the line width FWHM of the CO line and $D_{pc}$ is the diameter of the cloud in pc and using the average $V_{FWHM}$ for the six clouds given in Wilson et al. (1997) (= 9.3 km s$^{-1}$), we get an average $D_{cloud}$ = 60 pc. This gives us a filling factor of $ff$ = 0.5 and a corrected column density of 6-12 $\times$ 10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$. Converting this $^{12}$CO column density to H$_{2}$ column density using $x_{CO}$ = 3 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ we get $N$(H$_{2}$) = 2-4 $\times$ 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. Comparing this value to the RADEX solution's column density of region C, we see that region C has about 1.7-3.3 times the average column density of the six clouds in M33 in a 500pc region. This would imply that the beam is filled with clouds spaced close together and likely that there exists a large number of dense gas regions which could help explain the short depletion time and high star formation rate. 

We can also compare the average volume density we estimated in Chapter 3.5 to the average value of the six clouds in M33. Using the equation given in Wilson $\&$ Scoville (1990)
\begin{equation}
<n(H_{2})> = 200(D_{pc} / 20 pc)^{-1}
\end{equation}
 and the average cloud diameter, we get an average volume density of about 67 molecules cm$^{-3}$ for the clouds in M33. This is about 3 times larger than the value of region C. Using Equation 4.3, we see that the average volume density for region C corresponds to what we would except for a giant molecular cloud with a diameter of 200 pc. Region C is much larger than 200 pc which would imply that region C is in some sense overdense. However, for region C, we do not know the third dimension to get a proper volume. Our volume estimate is most likely to be overestimated and the average volume density is underestimated. If we use R=300 pc, we get an average volume density of 62 cm$^{-3}$ which is similar to the clouds of M33. This would imply that region C is similar to a 60 pc giant molecular cloud but on a larger scale. From the column density comparison, we see that looking at a line of sight, we will encounter a maximum 3 giant molecular clouds of about D=60 pc. We can use this to estimate the thickness of region C. If each cloud has a diameter of 60 pc and the space in between clouds are negligible, we can estimate the thickness to be 180 pc. Using the size of region C and this thickness we get an average volume density of about 100 cm$^{-3}$. This would imply that region C is much denser than a 60 pc cloud in M33 on a much larger scale!
  
Recently, RADEX modelling of the ``prototypical" ULIRG Arp 220 using FTS $Herschel$ data and a likelihood code was shown to have a two component molecular gas \citep{2011arXiv1106.5054R}, just as was shown in M82.  The most probable solution for the warm component was $T_{kin}$ $\sim$ 1340 K, $n$(H$_{2}$) = 10$^{3.2}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $N$($^{12}$CO) = 10$^{19.4}$ cm$^{-2}$ and for the cold component $T_{kin}$ $\sim$ 50 K, $n$(H$_{2}$) = 10$^{2.8}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $N$($^{12}$CO) = 10$^{20.3}$ cm$^{-2}$. These gas components are hotter and $N$($^{12}$CO) is higher than what we find for Arp 299. This difference may be because Arp 220 is in a later stage of the merger than Arp 299 where the nuclei are separated by 300 pc \citep{1997ApJ...484..702S}. 

Rangwala et al. (2011) have shown that the mid-J to high-J CO transition lines are tracing the warm/hot gas and the low-J CO transition lines are tracing the cold gas ($T \sim$ 50 K). This indicates that the $^{12}$CO J=3-2 transition line may not be tracing the hot gas component as we assumed earlier. In order to trace the warm/hot gas component we need to observe Arp 299 in higher $^{12}$CO transition lines.
