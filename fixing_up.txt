Introduction:

Observation:

SED section:
  - find where I got the calibration uncertaines
  - make a region map for kvis.  Should already be a figure on plumeria, but for consistency it would be best to try and do this in kvis.
  - Needed figures:
	-fig:regions — the figure showing the user defined regions of ngc3627
	-fig:param_fits — the big 3x3 figure
	-tab:beta_1, tab:beta_2, tab:beta_f
  - find a source citing 2 as an average value for beta
  - get the planck paper with the opacity values and li and draine papers
