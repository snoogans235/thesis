Introduction:

Observation:

SED section:
  - find where I got the calibration uncertaines
  - make a region map for kvis.  Should already be a figure on plumeria, but for consistency it would be best to try and do this in kvis.
  - Needed figures:
	-fig:regions â€” the figure showing the user defined regions of ngc3627
	-fig:wellness_1
	-fig:wellness_2
	-fig:wellness_3
  - find a source citing 2 as an average value for beta
  - get the planck 25 2011 paper with the opacity values and li and draine papers 2001 paper
