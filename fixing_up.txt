Observation Section:
  -maybe expand on calibration to uranus and the 450 and 850 beam
     sizes
  -background figure (fig_bg) is /1/homen/newtonjh/scuba2_test_ngc3627
     /previous/work_dir/scans/thesis_fig
  -get the scan speed of scuba-2
  -Use a plot showing what happens when you vary the fiter size
  -need to get information for obs_tab
  -show beams and calibration data in one figure
  -get 450$\mu$m and 850um bandwidth
  -get plots showing the amount of emission lost in fakesource/include
     in obs_tab
  -make images for all of the data
  -The introduction for some of the surveys might be a bit much.  I'm 
   sure chris will tell me if it is.
